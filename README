Poll Voter v1

Poll voter works great against polls that validate based on cookie or ip.                           
The only requirement is curl being installed.      

NOTES:                                                                                                                 
This produces a SHIT load of traffic. Don't use it for illegal purposes or face the music on your own.                 

Example:
